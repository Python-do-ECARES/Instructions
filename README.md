# Instructions
This repo contains instructions about how to use GitHub. Participants to the course are expected to follow a few simple rules in order to faciliate joint works and ensure reproducibility. 

## Dictionary
When learning a new language, one has to start from the basics. GitHub most fundamental words are: **repository**, **branch**, **merge**, **push** and **pull**. Take a look at [Hello World - GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) for a brief explanation of each of them.

## Installing GitHub Desktop
In this course, we interact with GitHub through the GitHub Desktop application. Download and install (GitHub Desktop)[https://desktop.github.com] on your computer. The installation process creates a folder named "GitHub". Make sure to know where it is located on your computer and/or change its directory where you prefer (e.g. Desktop).

## Class Organization
Each class has its own repository. You can find it under the [course homepage](https://github.com/Python-do-ECARES). In order to work on the weekly exercises, please follow the following instructions. 

### Step 1. Clone repository
Go to the relevant repo page on GitHub and click on the "Clone or download" button.

### Step 4. Next Steps
From now on, you can commit your chanes to your own branch anytime you want. You can also navigate to other people branches and see what they are up to. **Do not commit to their branches directly**. Instead, you can open a pull request to collaborate.
