# Setup
This repo contains instructions to setup what you need for this course.

## Anaconda distribution and Jupyter Notebooks
Python is a general programming language. To use it best for data science and economics, you may want to combine it with (1) [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and (2) [Python scientific libraries](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-10-python-libraries-for-data-science-cd82294ec266). The most convenient way to install Python (version 3.7), Jupyter notebooks and Python libraries is through [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/). **Please follow the steps below before the beginning of the course**.

- **Step 1**. Download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
- **Step 2**. Launch Anaconda and select Jupyter notebook or Jupyterlab.

We will use Jupyter notebooks as the main graphical interface to Python throughout the course. You can read more about how to install Anaconda [here](https://python.quantecon.org/getting_started.html). You can read about other popular Python IDEs [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/top-python-ides-for-2019).

## Git, GitHub, GitHub Desktop
Git is a *version control system*, i.e. a way to keep track of the whole history of things you do on a file. It is useful to save, manage and edit all the different versions of your project. GitHub is a web service that allows to conveniently work with Git. It allows you to create your own directories, see projects of other people and collaborate with them. There are [four subscription plans](https://github.com/pricing) to GitHub. We will work with the free one, which implies that *everybody* on GitHub can see our codes. However, with your academic email account, you can get a Pro account for free and create [private repositories](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/setting-repository-visibility#making-a-repository-public) as well. You can read more about GitHub [here](https://medium.com/@abhishekj/an-intro-to-git-and-github-1a0e2c7e3a2f) and [here](https://medium.com/launch-school/understanding-git-and-github-8ac987877a5).

### Setting up your GitHub environment
In this course, we interact with GitHub mostly through the GitHub Desktop application. In [Session 2](https://github.com/Python-do-ECARES/Classes) we discuss how to do it. For the moment, you can set up your own GitHub environment by following the steps below. **Please, make sure to do it before the beginning of the course**.

- **Step 1**. Create your own github account [here](https://github.com/).
- **Step 2**. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) on your computer.  The installation process creates a folder named "GitHub". Make sure to know where it is located and/or change its directory where you prefer (e.g. Desktop).
